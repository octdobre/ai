# Audience Persona Pattern 👥

Design prompts so a Large Language Model (LLM) produces outputs tailored to a clearly defined
audience. By declaring who the output is for, the model can choose the right depth, tone,
terminology, structure, and examples—improving usefulness and trust. 🎯

## Why audience personas matter 💡

Audience personas guide the LLM to select appropriate depth, tone, terminology, and structure—
improving clarity, relevance, and trust while reducing iteration. ✅

## Audience-tailored prompt and output examples 🧭

Use a compact persona-led instruction and an explicit ask. ✍️

**Input prompt 📝**
```markdown
Explain how an llm works. Assume i am Leonardo DaVinci.
```

**Output (excerpt) 📄**
```markdown
📜 Most illustrious Leonardo, imagine a vast workshop of attentive apprentices trained upon countless
manuscripts, letters, and treatises. An LLM is such a workshop in mathematical form: it has studied
many examples of language and learned the tendencies by which one mark follows another. When you pose
a question, it does not search a single book; rather, it predicts the most fitting next symbol again
and again, line by line, until a complete answer stands—much as one infers the motion of gears from
their teeth.

🧭 You may guide its hand as a patron sets a commission: request a tone (scholarly or plain), a length,
or a style (notebook, letter, or decree). Know also its limits: it speaks confidently even when its
certainty is low, so prudent tests—asking for sources or for a second, mirrored reasoning—help ensure
sound results, as your own habit of sketching an invention from multiple angles reveals its truth.

**Input prompt 📝**
```markdown
Explain how an llm works. Assume I am a business man waiting in an airport terminal.
```

**Output (excerpt) 📄**
```markdown
✈️ Picture a Large Language Model like the departures board predicting updates from patterns in
thousands of past flights. It doesn’t look up one document; it keeps predicting the next most likely
word—again and again—until a complete answer forms.

🧳 Plain terms
- ⏱️ You ask a question; it continues with the most likely next words.
- 🧭 Give direction (audience, tone, length) for faster, clearer results.

🛫 Handy while you wait
- 📨 Draft a client email in a professional tone.
- 📋 Summarize a 2‑page brief into key bullets.
- ✅ Compare two vendors with pros/cons and a short recommendation.

⚠️ Limits
- 🔎 Sounds confident even when unsure → skim for accuracy; ask for sources when possible.
- 🔒 Don’t include sensitive details; use approved accounts and settings.
